# ðŸ“£ **Summary**

This application (**Admin Dashboard**) was built using _React_ (Custom Hooks, Context), React-Router-Dom, useParams, Light/Dark Theme an theme color, Tailwind,Dynamic Routes, React-icons, API, Hosting and more! Authenticate using firebase and firestore so we can save user specific data and that data is retrieved using a custom hook with Protected Routes.

I used Tailwind CSS for this project and I really enjoyed using it. I used styled components in my previous project, but I have now converted all my projects to Tailwind CSS for ease of use.
